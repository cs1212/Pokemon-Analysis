# Pokemon-Analysis

With each new Pokemon generation, one may wonder if powercreep is present. Do Pokemon from new generations have better stats? Do new generations have something that older generations don't? This repo looks into some of those questions. Final notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/cs1212/Pokemon-Analysis/blob/main/Pokemon%20Exploration%20Final.ipynb)

# Data

Data was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon. It has pokemon info from gen1 to gen7 at the time of gen7's release.
